**Getting Started with Express.js: Building Your First Server**

If you're looking to dive into web development using Node.js, Express.js is a fantastic framework to start with. Express.js simplifies the process of creating robust and efficient web applications. In this quick guide, we'll walk you through setting up your first server using Express.js. Don't worry, we'll keep it simple and straightforward!

**Step 1: Installation**
First things first, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from the official Node.js website.

Once you have Node.js installed, open your terminal and create a new directory for your project. Navigate to this directory using the `cd` command. Now, let's initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This command creates a `package.json` file which will help manage your project's dependencies.

**Step 2: Installing Express.js**
With your project initialized, it's time to install Express.js. In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npm install express
```

This will install Express.js and save it as a dependency in your `package.json` file.

**Step 3: Creating the Server**
Now that you have Express.js installed, it's time to write some code! Create a new file named `index.js` in your project directory. This is where your server setup code will reside.

In `index.js`, add the following code:

```javascript
// Import the Express.js module
const express = require('express');

// Create an instance of the Express application
const app = express();
const port = 3000; // You can use any available port

// Define a route for the root URL
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

**Step 4: Starting the Server**
With your server code in place, it's time to start the server. In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see the message "Server is running on port 3000". Congratulations, your Express.js server is up and running!

**Step 5: Testing Your Server**
Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the text "Hello, Express!" displayed on the page. Congratulations, you've successfully set up your first Express.js server and created a basic route!

**Conclusion**
In this brief guide, you've learned the essential steps to set up your first Express.js server. We covered installing Express.js, creating a basic server with a route, and testing your server in a web browser. This is just the beginning â€“ Express.js offers a wide range of features for building powerful web applications. Now that you have a solid foundation, you can explore more advanced concepts and create even more impressive projects!
